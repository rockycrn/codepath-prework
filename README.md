# Pre-work - *Memory Game*

**Memory Game** is a Light & Sound Memory game to apply for CodePath's SITE Program. 

Submitted by: **Rosman R. Carino**

Time spent: 5 hours spent in total

Link to project: https://glitch.com/edit/#!/unruly-zigzag-dosa

## Required Functionality

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [X] Game interface has a heading (h1 tag), a line of body text (p tag), and four buttons that match the demo app
* [X] "Start" button toggles between "Start" and "Stop" when clicked. 
* [X] Game buttons each light up and play a sound when clicked. 
* [X] Computer plays back sequence of clues including sound and visual cue for each button
* [X] Play progresses to the next turn (the user gets the next step in the pattern) after a correct guess. 
* [X] User wins the game after guessing a complete pattern
* [X] User loses the game after an incorrect guess

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [ ] Any HTML page elements (including game buttons) has been styled differently than in the tutorial
* [ ] Buttons use a pitch (frequency) other than the ones in the tutorial
* [ ] More than 4 functional game buttons
* [ ] Playback speeds up on each turn
* [ ] Computer picks a different pattern each time the game is played
* [ ] Player only loses after 3 mistakes (instead of on the first mistake)
* [ ] Game button appearance change goes beyond color (e.g. add an image)
* [ ] Game button sound is more complex than a single tone (e.g. an audio file, a chord, a sequence of multiple tones)
* [ ] User has a limited amount of time to enter their guess on each turn

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [ ] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app!

## Reflection Questions
1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here. 

    None to Report.

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 

    A challenge that I encountered in this submission was the steps in the following section “Task 2: Record a gif of all the implemented features.” Even though I found it a challenge to interact with different software tools for the first time, I found it very rewarding. I have never used GitHub or even used tools to create a GIF. However, I will admit that the resources that were provided in the Pre-Work page allowed me to move forward. Specifically, the challenge I faced was when the presenter in the video entitled “Create Repository, Commit, and Push using GitHub Desktop” had the Pre-Work files in his Desktop – I could not find any steps in the Pre-Work Page nor on Glitch to download the files of code I had worked on. I thought there would be no way I could be able to upload the Pre-Work files I worked on into the GitHub repository. I was able to overcome this challenge by just continuing and reading/watching the provided walkthrough instructions in the Pre-Work page. My strategy was to hopefully find a piece of information that would allow me to be able to upload the Pre-Work files into the GitHub repository or to go into GitHub and try to find any information on how to upload project files from Glitch. Eventually I watched the video entitled “How To Export A Glitch Project to GitHub“ and I was able to figure out that I did not need to download the Pre-Work files onto my computer and then upload them into the GitHub repository – Instead I can just export the Pre-Work files directly into the GitHub repository. 

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) 

    I have a lot of questions about web development after completing this submission, but I think my questions will be more targeted if I were to learn more about web development. My first question would be: Why do we need three-programming languages for a website? I have been exposed to writing programs like what we did in JavaScript, but not in the other two. Would we need to implement more programming languages for more complex tasks like adding videos (E.X. – YouTube), music, live-stream entertainment? Additionally, what kind of maintenance (Updates, Bugs, etc.) do we do in web-development? Where exactly do we implement data structures and algorithms into websites? How do we measure efficiency in web development? 

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) 

    Unfortunately, I did not know about this opportunity until a day and a half before the due date. However, I would have like to improve the project overall in terms of appearance and adding more features that the user would appreciate. Specifically, I would have liked to add the following features: Speed it Up, Use a Random Secret Pattern, Give the Player 3 Strikes, and Add a Ticking Clock. I believe offering a user more options for this game is beneficial because they will enjoy the game more. Additionally, I would have gone back and understand the code we were provided at a deeper level in each step of the Pre-Work page. I think by going back and understanding the starter code would give me more understanding behind the project and if I’m asked about the latter, I can provide a clear explanation. Finally, I’m not sure if writing test cases is used in Web Development, but I think it is a good idea to see if there are any bugs in our implementation before we “roll out” the project to users.
